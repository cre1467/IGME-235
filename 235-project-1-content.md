# Nascency: Battle of the Alchemists

## Concept
Starting with minimal items, carefully combine them in your cauldron to get new,
 stronger items, and use them to attack your opponent and defend yourself
 against them.

 ## Genre Virtual card game

 ## Platform Designed for web, mobile-friendly

 ## Story
 You are a poor sorcerer dabbling in alchemy, and have but two gold coins. If
 you use these wisely, you may rise to become the most powerful sorcerer in the
 kingdom.

 ## Aesthetics
The graphics in the game will be pixel art. The sound will be ambient music
suitable for a medieval time period. ## Gameplay ### Mechanics The game
consists of a number of cards that you may possess, either by buying or
brewing. You begin with only two gold coin cards, and must increase your
wealth and power from there. The cards purchasable at the apothecary(store) are

| Item                | Cost |
| ------------------- | ---- |
| 2 Garlic Cloves     | 1    |
| Lead Dust           | 2    |
| Chopped Rose Petals | 2    |
| Frog's Blood        | 3    |
| Snake Oil           | 4    |
| Green Grapes        | 4    |
| Unicorn Horn        | 5    |
| Fire Potion         | 8    |

These can be brewed to create new items, some of which are not available in the
apothecary. The combinations are as follows.
* Gold Coin + Garlic Clove = 2 Gold Coins
* Frog's Blood + Snake Oil = Fire Potion
* Lead Dust + Fire Potion = Eternal Darkness Brew
* Copper Dust + Eternal Darkness Brew = Organ Poisoning Brew
* Gold Coin + Eternal Darkness Brew + Organ Poisoning Brew = Emerald of Power
* 2 Unicorn Horns + Fire Potion = Unicorn Horn Powder
* Chopped Rose Petals + unicorn Horn Powder = Diamond of Immortality
* Squid Eye (if you possess the Book of Secrets) = 3 Gold Coins
* The Book of Secrets is a rare drop acquired by raiding the apothecary You can
attack or defend yourself with items that have a strength. This is determined as
the total cost of the ingredients in Gold Coins plus the number of brewing steps
required to make it. The Diamond of Immortality is unique in that it cannot be
used offensively, but it is the only defense against the almighty Emerald of
Power.

 ### Control
 The controls for desktop are mouse only. For mobile the only control is
  tapping.

### Player Learning
Like "real" Alchemy, the player is not taught anything, but must experiment with
brews until they create something. The prices are such that the player is
forced to discovered the garlic + coin brew very early. There is no penalty for
attempting a brew that doesn't work, your turn is not over until you make a
valid brew.

## Screenshots A screenshot of a mockup can be seen
[here](https://people.rit.edu/cre1467/235/project1/images/Capture.PNG). Colors
are added simply to show contrast between sections and are not intended in the
final version.

## Other
While I cannot remember all the details, this game is based roughly on a card
game I made in middle school.  In making the game, I think using jQuery may be
useful, but in the process of development, I will likely discover that other
tool, like PixiJS, will be more effective.

## About the Developer
Cole Easton is a second year Game Design and Development student who is excited
to create worlds and design new and innovative ways to approach algorithms in
game development. He is especially interested in procedural generation and
rendering engines, and hopes to eventually make some contributions to those
fields.  Once he graduates he'd like to work for a game company working on
either engines or procedural generation algorithms. Eventually he'd like to
start his own game company.
